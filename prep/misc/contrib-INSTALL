Installation instruction for the HUJI-contrib package:
------------------------------------------------------

Infod:
------

1. Copy "infod" and "infod-ctl", to /sbin.
   (if you are not permitted to add programs to /sbin, place them in
    /usr/sbin or /usr/local/sbin)

2. Copy "infod-client", "infod-best" and "mmon" to /bin.
   (if you are not permitted to add programs to /bin, place them in
    /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin)
   
   2.1  Copy the file mmon.cfg.example either to your home directory
        under the name .mmon.cfg or to /etc/mosix/mmon.cfg. In the first
        case the mmon definitions will be private and in the second case
        the definitions will be global to all users. In any case the 
        presence of a private file override global definitions.     


3. Add code to automatically start "infod" to a startup-script
   in "/etc/init.d" (either to an existing script, or add a new one).
   You may use the supplied infod.init script (change its name to 
   /etc/init.d/infod). You can edit the file to make it suitable to your 
   installation. Especially note the INFOD_ARGS variable that let you 
   pass arguments to the infod daemon

4. Make sure that the file "/etc/mosix/userview.map" contains the list
   of nodes you wish infod the monitor. Alternately, you can create
   a different file with the list of nodes you want infod to monitor: 
   this requires passing the option "--mapfile <file-name>" to infod.

   Example how to run infod:  

     /sbin/infod --maptype userview --mapfile /etc/userview.map

   Useview map file example:
   ----------------- Example start --------------------------------
   # A comment
   # The following line defines a cluster with 25 nodes with consecutive
   # IP addresses. The first node is # mos1 which gets id 1; the second
   # is mos2 with id 2, etc.
   1 mos1 25
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

5. Start infod in all the nodes in your cluster.

6. To view the status of your cluster, either run "mmon" in one of the
   cluster nodes, or "mmon -h <node-name>" from outside the cluster.



Testload:
---------
Copy "testload", and "repeat-bg" to any desired location in your PATH.
