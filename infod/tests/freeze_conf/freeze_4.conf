# Freeze dir

# Freeze configuration - a class per line, first 4 fields are mandatory:
# 1. class #
# 2. load-units (for the next 4 constants): 0=processes, 1=MOSIX load
# 3. Red mark: above this start freezing ; floating-point allowed ; -1=none
# 4. Blue mark: above this start unfreezing ; floating-point allowed
# 5. Red auto-freeze: above this, evacuated-to-home procs come frozen (-1=none)
# 6. Red clust-freeze: above this, evacuated-to-cluster come frozen (-1=none)
# 7. Minimimum processes to keep running - even if load above red mark.
# 8. Maximum processes to allow running - even if load below blue mark.
# 9. time slice (minutes): when other processes of class are waiting to run.
