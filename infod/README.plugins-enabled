/etc/gossimon/plugins-enabled

This directory should contain all the configuration files
for all the enabled modules. Each configuration file should end
with .conf suffix. When infod/mmon starts the name of all the files
ending with .conf are detected. For each such file the equivalent 
.so file is loaded from /usr/share/gossimon/plugins.

Usually the files in this directory will be soft links to files
in the /etc/gossimon/plugins-abailable
